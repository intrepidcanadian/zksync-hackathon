# hackathon

This project leverages the gated-nft-tutorial-starter for the zksync hackathon. 

The goal is to add a email verification to allow people on an email list to be eligible for gas-less transactions

Currently the logic allows for gas to be paid on behalf of email subscribers. 

You would need to set up the email server and initialize the front end
